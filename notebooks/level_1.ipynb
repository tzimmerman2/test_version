        "## Maze Challenge Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "For Level 1, there are 3 mazes that do not change! Your goal is to solve all mazes, and get the highest score for all three of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the rules for the maze challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Goal:** Navigate the robot from the starting point (🏁) to the goal (🏆) in each maze. The starting point will always be (0,0) and the goal will always be (4,4).\n",
        "2.  **Movement:** You can only move to adjacent cells (N, S, W, or E) if there is no wall between your current position and the desired cell.\n",
        "3.  **Cherry:** There is a cherry (🍒) in the maze. Collecting the cherry is optional but will give you bonus points.\n",
        "4.  **Information:** Your `choose_move` method in the `MySolver` class only has access to the current robot's position, the cherry's position, and a dictionary of possible moves from your current location. You do not have a global view of the maze.\n",
        "5.  **Max Moves:** Your agent has a maximum of 2,000 moves to reach the end of the maze.\n",
        "6.  **Main Scoring:**\n",
        "    *   You start with a base score of **10,000 points**.\n",
        "    *   Points are then adjusted based on your performance:\n",
        "        *   **Penalty:** **-100 points** for each unit of Manhattan distance between your final position and the goal (ignoring walls).\n",
        "        *   **Penalty:** **-10 points** for each move made beyond the shortest possible path to the goal.\n",
        "        *   **Bonus:** **+500 points** if you collect the cherry.\n",
        "7.  **Explorer Scoring:** The explorer score encourages the robot to explore as much of the maze as possible while still being efficient in its movement. It is calculated as:\n",
        "    * **Bonus:** **+10 points** for each unique cell visited.\n",
        "    * **Penalty:** **-1 point** for each move made.\n",
        "8.  **Objective:** Your goal is to solve all three mazes and get the highest scores possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pointers for Solving\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some pointers to help you improve your maze solver:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Try hard-coding your directions:** Since the mazes aren't changing, you can solve the mazes by programming the order of the moves the robot does. The `self.actions` list is already set up to do this.\n",
        "*   **The Cherry:** Think about how you can integrate collecting the cherry into your strategy. Is it always worth going for? How can you determine if it's \"on the way\"?\n",
        "*   **Consider Algorithms:** Once you've mastered the hard-coded solutions, consider common maze-solving algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or even simple wall-following can be adapted to this problem. Remember you only have local information, so a standard implementation might need modification.\n",
